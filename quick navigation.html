                    <h2>05 Dudhsagar Waterfalls</h2>
                    <img src="image/dudhsagar waterfalls.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        The Dudhsagar Waterfalls are situated on the Goa-Karnataka border and are one of India’s must-see sights. The four-tiered waterfall structure is one of the tallest in India and is located on the Mandovi River. The white water cascades down from a <span class="read-more-text">height of nearly 1017 feet off a nearly steep mountain face. They form a part of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, so the best way to reach them is by entering the national park and taking a van allocated by the park to the falls.
                        The Dudhsagar trek inside the park is closed to the public but you can still reach the waterfalls by trekking from Kulem and following the jeep trail. Another possible route is the trek from Castle Rock in Karnataka. Reaching the waterfalls will not be an easy task but it is one that is worth every ounce of effort put into it.  They are best experienced during the monsoons as they lose their force during the dry season.
                        
                        Many tours are organized over this time so you can choose to go as a part of a group. Some tours even have overnight camping options. But remember to go well-prepared to ensure a good experience, especially if you are going on a self-organized trek. The lush green jungle and the beautiful waterfall sending up their forceful sprays are a sight to remember long after you have left Dudhsagar behind.
                        
                        Location: Sanguem Taluka
                        
                        How to reach from Panaji: Take a train up to Kulem railway station. However, don’t expect a proper platform here. It is a rough stop.</span>

                    Benaulim Beach is a serene beach situated about 2 kilometres south of Colva. It is a fishing beach, which is known for its calm and relaxed nature. If you’re a tourist in search of a relaxing and rejuvenating holiday,<span class="read-more-text1">Benaulim beach might be the place for you.

                    This beach is almost hidden from the large crowds that surge through the North Goan beaches and in spite of having a considerable fishing industry, tourists aren't aware of it. The weather here is much like other places in Goa with hot summers, pleasant winters and torrential monsoons. One thing that makes Benaulim stand out from other Goan beaches is how clean and calm it is.
                    
                    Benaulim Beach is so clean because it is away from the noisy crowds that we normally associate Goa with. There are several kilometres of just smooth white sand with a few fishing trawlers scattered here and there. Although most of the time, Benaulim is a quiet paradise, it does tend to get a little crowded in the evenings as tourists come to enjoy the west-coast Indian sunset. The beach also tends to get crowded during the weekends.
                    
                    Being far away from the energy of the city, time works differently on Benaulim Beach, and this place gives tourists the perfect getaway.</span>

                <img src="image/spice plantations visit.jpg" alt=""> 
                <p>For many people, Goa is all about the beaches and the nightclubs. This has influenced its popular public image to the extent that we forget that there is more to Goa than the beaches. In truth, Goa is also the hub of many types of spice Plantations. A huge variety of the common spices that we<span class="read-more-text3"> use at home, as well as the more exotic and expensive varieties reserved for special occasions, are grown here. By making a visit to these plantations, you get right into the natural habitat of the ingredients so beloved in Indian kitchens. In your Goa trip you must take a day time to visit this plantation.

                    You can take a tour of the plantation and understand how the spices are grown, what goes into making them strong and appealing, and why certain spices cost as much as they do. You can also get some useful usage tips that might just transform your cooking experiences. Apart from the actual spice farming, you will also find yourself having a good time drinking the special teas offered on the plantations, eating the delicious home-made food delicately tinged with homegrown spices, and enjoying the general ambiance of the space.
                    
                    If you can manage it, go during the monsoon season. Any farm is worth a visit when the falling rains fill the air with a lovely scent but imagine how compounded this effect will be on a spice plantation. Spice Plantations are one of most delightful the places to visit in Goa, so don’t miss out on them. Savoi Spice Plantation, Sahakari Spice Farms, Tropical Spice Plantation are some plantations to look into. Most are located roughly 30km from Panaji and easily accessible via cabs. </span><span class="read-more-btn3">Read More</span></p>

                <h2>21 Verna Springs</h2>
                <img src="image/verna springs.jpg" alt=""> 
                <p>Verna Springs, popularly known as Kesarval Springs, are located near the Verna Cliffs, hence the name. ‘Kesarval’, on the other hand, is a reference to the days of old when eagles(kesar-val) had a nesting ground near the springs. The eagles are gone but the springs gush out from between the huge <span class="read-more-text3">rocks and green trees just as chirpily as ever. This is a good spot to visit for some nature sighting. The surroundings are quiet and only the hum of the forest fauna is to be heard and one of the best places to visit in Goa with family.

                    The Verna Springs, however, might be a little noisier on account of the many people who frequent the Springs. The Verna Springs are popular not only for their natural beauty but also for their rumored healing properties. The water from the Springs is said to hold curative properties. The skin, eyes, internal ailments can all purportedly be cured by a dip in the water of Verna Springs. As a result, you will come across all manner of people here who are enjoying a taste of the waters in the hope of curing some physical ailment or the other.
                    
                    The Springs are big enough to take this influx of people and they are active enough to sweep away the resultant dirt in their strong currents. The best time to visit is during the monsoon season when the water is flowing at full force even though they continue to exist in the dry season albeit to a much less forceful extent. Take a spare set of clothes or your swimming costume along if you too wish to take a dip in them. </span><span class="read-more-btn3">Read More</span></p>

Goan tamarind is noted for its delicious taste so do grab some of it.

One of the ‘hidden’ Goa tourist places, Lamgau Caves are made up of two man-made caves which were meant to be a residence for monks. They are of great importance to the Hindu community in Goa and they<span class="read-more-text4"> reflect the transition from Buddhism to Hinduism. The caves are designed in a Buddhist fashion but the idols of Nandi and the Shivaling outside the main entrance of the smaller of the two caves reveal another aspect.

                    The other cave is much larger and is basically a place where one can sit and meditate or take shelter from the rains. The scenic route up to the caves is another reason to visit them. The caves are located inside a dense areca nut plantation and trekking up to them can get tough because of the rugged nature of the paths. You pass several small Goan villages on your way, these are good and hospitable resting spots during the trek.
                    
                    The many interesting local temples on the way are an added attraction of the trek up to Lamgau Caves. You can visit the caves on some early morning.

Hence the numerous battles that took place here for control.

                    The Fort was rebuilt by the British in 1705. Though it has fallen into disuse now, it is still an attractive spot and you might come across history buffs and architecture enthusiasts going over the fort for its structure and its past.
