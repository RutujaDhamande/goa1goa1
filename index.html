                    Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margao in Goa still exhibits the culture influence of the Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early 16th century as merchants, and conquered it soon threafter, whereupon Goa became an oversesa territory of the Portuguese Empire, part of what was then known as Portugues India, and remained as such for about 450 years, until it was annexed by India in 1961. Goa's official language, which is spoken by a majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani.<br>
                    
                    Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year because of its white-sand beaches, place of worship and World Heritage-listed architecture. It also has rich flora and funa because its lies on the Western Ghats range, a biodiversity hotspot.<br>
                    
                    After the Bahmani-Bijapuri city of Goa was captured by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1510, and was made the capital of the Estado da India, the city gave its name to the contiguous territories. The origin of the city name Goa is unclear. In ancient literature, Goa was known by many names, such as Gomanchala, Gopakapattana, Gopakapattam, Gopakapuri, Gopakapuri, Govapuri, Govem and Gomantak. Other historical name for Goa are Sindapur, Sandabur and Mahassapatam.</span>  <button type="button" id="reads1" onclick="read112

                    Goa has two World Heritage Sites: the Bom Jesus Basilica and churches and convents of Old Goa. The basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Franci Xavier, regarded by many Catholics as the patron saint of Goa (the patronn of the Archdiocese of Goa is actually Saint Joseph Vaz).
